<p>
DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference that brings together leaders in Software Development and IT Operations to collaborate and learn from each other. It is both a technical conference and a conference focusing on culture, processes, and structures within organizations. We encourage both technologists and managers to attend, learn, and share experiences.

### Become a Sponsor

As a self-organizing conference, DevOpsDays depends on sponsorships. By partnering with DevOpsDays youÂ´ll get the opportunity to network and build relationships with highly motivated developers, sysadmins, IT executives, and managers within the burgeoning Scandinavian DevOps community.
<p>
Our sponsorship packages are constructed to offer our partners lead generation, networking, branding, and talent recruitment.

Sponsorship packages will be published soon.
